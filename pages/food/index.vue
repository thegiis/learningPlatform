    summary="Nature provides conditions and direct contributions for food production.  Globally food production has been increasing but unsustainable food production has negatively impacted Nature causing environmental pollution and biodiversity loss.  We are producing more food than we require hence majority of food produced is wasted.  To ensure food supply and preserve nature, some of the things we can do are: change our dietary habits, reduce food waste and consume locally produce foods."

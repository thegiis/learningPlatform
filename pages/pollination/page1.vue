      <h2 class="title2">What is Pollination?</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          Pollination is one of the most fascinating processes in our nature.
          Pollination is how flowering plants reproduce. To produce offspring, a
          plant needs to be fertilised, which allows it to develop seeds that
          will grow into new plants.

          Flowers need external agents to move pollens from the male parts to
          female parts. Normally, pollen are transferred by wind, water, birds,
          bees, butterflies, bats, and other animals that visit flowers. We call
          animals or insects that transfer pollen from male organ to female
          organ “pollinators”.

      <h2 class="title2">Plants and their pollinators</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          When a mature plant is ready to reproduce, its buds swell and open
          into flowers. A pollinator visits a flower to eat nectar and pollen.
          The pollen grains from the flower will rub onto the pollinator and
          stick to its body. As the pollinator moves from flower to flower, its
          body collects more pollen. As the pollinator continues to visit more
          flowers, its body is rubbed off against the female part of the flower,
          and pollen is deposited on the stigma facilitating fertilization to
          occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are approximately 350,000 species of known pollinators (bees,
          flies, butterflies, moths, wasps, beetles, birds, and bats) serving
          approximately 352,000 species of flowering plants. The vast majority
          of pollinator species are wild while some species such as honeybees
          are managed by humans.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s look at some of the most common pollinators:</p>
        <p>
          <b>Bees:</b> Bees are the most well known pollinators. Bees collect
          pollen and nectar not only for themselves but also to feed their young
          larvae. For this reason bees have developed a number of adaptive
          features that make them particularly good pollen carriers. Bees are
          fuzzy and carry an electrostatic charge. Both features help pollen
          grains attach to their bodies, but they also have specialized
          pollen-carrying structures. They have special hairs that are arranged
          to form “pollen baskets' on their hind legs and the underside of their
          abdomen. Bees are not picky and frequently visit a large variety of
          flowers. These adaptive characters allow bees to gather and carry
          large volumes of pollen and make them one of the most successful
          pollinators.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are benefiting from the hard work of bees, when we are eating foods
          such as apples, grapes, pears, peaches, almonds, pumpkins,
          watermelons, cabbage, cauliflower, coffee, berries, mustard, onions
          and potatoes. Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops are
          pollinated by both domesticated and wild bees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Butterflies:</b> Butterflies like to sit on larger flower heads
          when they hunt nectar, collecting pollen on their legs and body as
          they search for food. The legs and the butterfly's proboscis are
          longer and farther away from the flower's pollen so less pollen
          collects on its body parts than it does on bees, but still they are
          very effective pollinators. Butterflies pollinate vegetables and herbs
          such as carrots, peas, beans, fennel and cilantro.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Flies:</b> Flies are primary pollinators for many plant species
          such as pears, apples, strawberries, cherries, plums, apricots,
          peaches, rowanberries, raspberries, blackberries, roses, mangoes,
          fennel, coriander, caraway, kitchen onions, parsley, and carrots.
          Without flies, there would be no chocolate. Chocolate midge flies
          pollinate cacao trees native to Central America, South America,
          Africa, and Asia. The tiny insects are about one to three millimetres
          long, allowing them to fit inside the plant's small flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to bees, which need to collect nectar not only for themselves
          but also their hives, adult flies have low requirements. Although this
          makes flies less devoted to the task of moving quickly between
          flowers, it also frees them to bask in flowers and remain active at
          low temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some plant’s flowers have adapted putrid smelling blossoms to attract
          certain fly pollinators looking for rotting meat. Some flowers have
          even adapted to look like rotting meat, usually having a brownish red
          color.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Bats:</b> Bats are very important pollinators in tropical and
          desert climates. They feed on the insects in the flowers as well as on
          the nectar and flower parts. Over 300 species of fruit depend on bats
          for pollination. Over 300 species of fruit depend on bats for
          pollination. These fruits include: mangoes, bananas, guavas, durian
          and dragonfruits. Bats are attracted to dull white, green or purple
          flowers that emit strong, musty odors at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hummingbirds:</b> Because hummingbirds feed frequently and have a
          long needle like beak, they are ideal pollinators for many flowers.
          Hummingbirds have long, slender bills (beak) and tube-like tongues
          that they use to drink nectar from brightly-colored flowers.
          Hummingbirds are attracted to scarlet, orange, red or white
          tubular-shaped flowers with no distinct odors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sunbirds:</b> Sunbird species can drink nectar while hovering, but
          usually perch to feed. Their long curved beaks and long, brush-tipped
          tongues make these birds particularly suited to feeding on and
          pollinating tubular flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunbirds play a major role in pollinating rhododendrons, common
          species of the Himalayas.

            Plants and pollinators evolved together side by side over millions
            of years. Plants developed many complex ways of attracting
            pollinators. The great variety in color, form, and scent we see in
            flowers is a direct result of the intimate relationship of flowers
            with pollinators. Similarly, pollinators evolved with specialized
            physical traits and behaviors that enhance their pollination
            efforts. These methods include visual cues, scent, food, mimicry,
            and entrapment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, many pollinators have evolved specialized structures and
            behaviors to assist in plant pollination such as the fur on the face
            of the black and white ruffed lemur or a bat. Animal pollinated
            flowering plants produce pollen that is sticky and barbed to attach
            to the animal and thus be transferred to the next flower.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plants don’t always need pollination for reproduction. There are
            many plants (around 6% of total plant species) that reproduce
            asexually. This method does not require the plants to produce a
            flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal.
